Makin' a website to showcase my art!

Plans are to make it similar to my notion home page in terms of style: some yellows, browns, greens, and serif font.
Not sure how to make dropdowns selectors, that's going to be a challenge.

If you're interested, please check out my work at [website to be created].

Let's strap up those programming socks and make a site!
